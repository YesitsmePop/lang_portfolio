My name is most often said to mean “by the sea” or “from the sea.” I’ve always thought that was interesting, though I don’t think most people ever picture the ocean when they hear it. More often, they jump straight to well-known names like Morgan Freeman or Morgan Wallen. For me, though, the name doesn’t feel tied to fame or even the sea. It feels like something that simply fits into its place, quietly blending in—until it meets my last name, McDonald, which tends to stand out for reasons that are a little less graceful.

I’ve never struggled with my first name, and because of that, I’ve never really had nicknames that stuck. In my family, names don’t tend to repeat themselves through generations the way they do in some cultures, so “Morgan” seems to begin with me. My middle name, though—Dean—was taken from my grandfather on my mom’s side, and that connection means a lot to me. My grandpa has always been someone I look up to: steady, humorous, and accomplished. Carrying part of his name feels like carrying part of what he represents in my life.

The harder part of my name, if there is one, comes with my last name. Almost every time I introduce myself as McDonald, people immediately bring up the fast-food chain. The jokes are predictable, and while they’re not the worst thing to deal with, they get old fast. Still, I think those small frustrations have made me more patient and taught me to brush off things I can’t control. For that reason, I wouldn’t change my name. It may not always be easy, but it feels entirely mine—and I’ve learned to take pride in that.
