Living in a world where substance abuse and the will to fit in can become so prevalent, it occurs to me that such problems come to be prevalent in most every public setting of large scale, and that does not rule out High School. 

Testing for Nicotine and Drug use in school settings arises much discussion on whether it is ethical or for that matter necessary in these settings, however I think that with the rise of suicidal thoughts in teenagers during this time period paired with the greater access to such substances, the issue presented becomes clear. 

That is not to say that I believe radical implementations should be applied widescale, however since the US Supreme Court did rule drug use testing legal, it wouldn’t be entirely detrimental to exercise concern for the situation, whether that be gradual implementation of testing per se with the rising grade levels amongst schools similar to GDLs, or another form of caution, testing, even on the experimental level would in most cases not present itself a challenge but rather an insight to a school’s genuine status with drug use. 

Additionally, I believe that some of the state funding that has been put into security features of schools such as gates (I know that Ripon High has installed one over the summer) or other protocol are not the main concern of schools well-being, and efforts should rather be made to limit illegal activity within the student body, as opposed to protecting from outside threats. 

This of course is highly dependent on the region the school is located in and its status relevant to surrounding schools/towns, such as for instance a school in a larger city versus a rural town that is miles and miles away from any other form of civilization. 

However, data varies, and based on what we already know, there is not a noticeable difference between the rate of drug use in similarly comparable schools when one school tests for drug use and the other does not, however this should not rule out the fact that schools being aware of these trends within their student body should most certainly aid in efforts to continue administration with the aim to lower these rates for the good and well-being of the students themselves.
