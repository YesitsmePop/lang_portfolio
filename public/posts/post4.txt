The pizza delivery guy is meant to represent the icon of the servant in our world, and more specifically the servant of capitalism. He is the one devoted to our needs, and in some cases we can be the servant as well. 

One outstanding principle of being cool to the pizza dude is to practice humility and forgiveness. Everyone needs some of this in their life, and doing so not only makes the servant’s job more efficient, but also allows yourself to benefit from the side effects of good morals and not suffer self-judgement for actions done in your past. This is especially helpful in the mutual relationship between the servant and the one being served, because the pizza dude does his part in society while you help him to continue serving others joyfully by not being a pain. This gives reason to continue his work, and continues the cycle. This behaviour, such as giving the delivery guy a tip or coming prepared with what your order is to a fast food restaurant, is additionally a practice in empathy, which I believe beneficial more so to ourselves than we know it, and should be taken seriously, rather than pushed aside as though it won’t be accepted graciously. 

The act of respecting the servant is one I am most surprised to find is close to never upheld in the modern world, and deserves the greatest attention, because as the NIV edition of the bible states in Isaiah 42:1-4, “Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him... he will bring justice to the nations.” This practice ensures equality among people as well, which furthermore supports the statement that between servant and master, no one is above the other. 

For these reasons and more, it is necessary that we remain respectful and uphold a sentiment of “coolness” to the pizza delivery dude. He’ll appreciate it, and it’s a two way street as well.
