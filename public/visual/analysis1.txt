In the provided political cartoon, this illustration is attempting to capture a man handing a blank piece of paper to a government official, who, not understanding the form of peace treaty, is told to tie it to a stick and wave it, as in the form of surrender. 

Speaker: The speaker is cartoonist Michael Ramirez, as indicated by the signature at the bottom. Ramirez is a prize-winning editorial cartoonist known for his conservative perspective, and has worked for several major publications. Based on the speaker's conservative outlook on the situation of Ukraine and Russia, it can be inferred this cartoon was constructed in a negative perception of Putin's political drives.

Purpose: Ramirez created this illustration in effort to persuade the audience that Russian peace proposals are empty gestures lacking sincerity, and should rather be rejected. The cartoon generally responds to the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflicts, and hopes that the audience view Russian peace offers essentially as demands for surrender.

Audience: The speaker is trying to reach mainly the population of the USA that consume editorial and political cartoons. We know this due to the piece being circulated in American media outlets, using english text, and assumes the audience be aware of the ongoing conflict with Russia and Ukraine.

Context: The piece was created during the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflicts that begun with Russia's full-scale invasion starting in 2022. At the time, Ukraine was actively resisting Russia's military aggression, various people were proposing peace agreements and ceasefires, and the US and NATO were providing significant military and financial support.

Exigence: The immediate catalyst for the illustration was likely a Russian peace proposal or diplomatic initiative that caused public awareness of the conflict. This development may have prompted Ramirez to respond due to viewing it as dangerous and could potentially lead to abandoning Ukraine under the disguise of "peace."
